## Set Up Network and HTTP Load Balancers

There are several ways you can [load balance on Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/load-balancing-overview#a_closer_look_at_cloud_load_balancers). This lab takes you through the set up of the following load balancers:

[Network Load Balancer](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/load-balancing/network/)
[HTTP(s) Load Balancer](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/load-balancing/http/)

Open the cloud shell and do the basic checks using ```gcloud auth list``` and ```gcloud config list project```

Setup default region and zone for all resources using ```gcloud config set compute/zone us-central1-a``` (zone) and ```gcloud config set compute/region us-central1``` (region)

## Create multiple web server instances
For this load balancing example, we create 3 Compute Engine VM instances and install Apache on them, then add a firewall rule that allows HTTP traffic to reach the instances.

Create three new virtual machines in your default zone and give them all the same tag. The code provided sets the zone to us-central1-a. 
Setting the tags field lets you reference these instances all at once, such as with a firewall rule. These commands also install Apache on each instance and give each instance a unique home page

Steps to be followed ---->
1. Creating VM instances and installing apache on them (notice that --tags flag are same in all instances)

<br>

    gcloud compute instances create www1 \
    --image-family debian-9 \
    --image-project debian-cloud \
    --zone us-central1-a \
    --tags network-lb-tag \
    --metadata startup-script="#! /bin/bash
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install apache2 -y
    sudo service apache2 restart
    echo '<!doctype html><html><body><h1>www1</h1></body></html>' | tee /var/www/html/index.html"

<br>

    gcloud compute instances create www2 \
    --image-family debian-9 \
    --image-project debian-cloud \
    --zone us-central1-a \
    --tags network-lb-tag \
    --metadata startup-script="#! /bin/bash
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install apache2 -y
    sudo service apache2 restart
    echo '<!doctype html><html><body><h1>www2</h1></body></html>' | tee /var/www/html/index.html"

<br>
    
    gcloud compute instances create www3 \
    --image-family debian-9 \
    --image-project debian-cloud \
    --zone us-central1-a \
    --tags network-lb-tag \
    --metadata startup-script="#! /bin/bash
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install apache2 -y
    sudo service apache2 restart
    echo '<!doctype html><html><body><h1>www3</h1></body></html>' | tee /var/www/html/index.html"

(The '/' is just for specifying line breaks and easy viewing commands, if you prefer to write in one single line, dont add the '/')

2. Create a firewall rule to allow external traffic to the VM instances using the command ```gcloud compute firewall-rules create www-firewall-network-lb --target-tags network-lb-tag --allow tcp:80```

3. Now you need to get the external IP addresses of your instances and verify that they are running. To list your instances, use command ```gcloud compute instances list```, the external IP column would display the external IP

4. Verify that each instance is running with ```curl```, replacing [IP_ADDRESS] with the IP address for each of your VMs using the command ```curl http://[IP_ADDRESS]```

## Configure the load balancing service

When you configure the load balancing service, your virtual machine instances will receive packets that are destined for the static external IP address you configure. Instances made with a Compute Engine image are automatically configured to handle this IP address
[Setting Up Network Load Balancing](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/load-balancing/network/)

Steps to be followed ---->
1. Create a static external IP address for your load balancer using the command ```gcloud compute addresses create network-lb-ip-1 --region us-central1```

2. Add a legacy HTTP health check resource using the command ```gcloud compute http-health-checks create basic-check```

3. Add a target pool in the same region as your instances. Run the following to create the target pool and use the health check, which is required for the service to function using the command ```gcloud compute target-pools create www-pool --region us-central1 --http-health-check basic-check```

4. Add the instances to the pool using the command ```gcloud compute target-pools add-instances www-pool --instances www1,www2,www3``` where ```www1```, ```www2```, ```www3``` are the names of the just created VMs

5. Add a forwarding rule
```
    gcloud compute forwarding-rules create www-rule \
    --region us-central1 \
    --ports 80 \
    --address network-lb-ip-1 \
    --target-pool www-pool
```

(These are pretty self explanatory on its own)

## Sending traffic to your instances
To view the external IP address of the www-rule forwarding rule used by the load balancer, use the command ```gcloud compute forwarding-rules describe www-rule --region us-central1```

Use ```curl``` command to access the external IP address, replacing IP_ADDRESS with an external IP address from the previous command as ```while true; do curl -m1 IP_ADDRESS; done``` for sending multiple requests in an infinite loop
(use ```CTRL+C``` to stop sending the requests) 

The response from the curl command alternates randomly among the three instances. if your response is initially unsuccessful, wait approximately 30 seconds for the configuration to be fully loaded and for your instances to be marked healthy before trying again

## Create an HTTP load balancer
HTTP(S) Load Balancing is implemented on Google Front End (GFE). GFEs are distributed globally and operate together using Google's global network and control plane. You can configure URL rules to route some URLs to one set of instances and route other URLs to other instances. Requests are always routed to the instance group that is closest to the user, if that group has enough capacity and is appropriate for the request. If the closest group does not have enough capacity, the request is sent to the closest group that does have capacity

To set up a load balancer with a Compute Engine backend, your VMs need to be in an instance group. The managed instance group provides VMs running the backend servers of an external HTTP load balancer. For this lab, backends serve their own hostnames

1. First, create the load balancer template
    ```
    gcloud compute instance-templates create lb-backend-template \
    --region=us-central1 \
    --network=default \
    --subnet=default \
    --tags=allow-health-check \
    --image-family=debian-9 \
    --image-project=debian-cloud \
    --metadata=startup-script='#! /bin/bash
    apt-get update
    apt-get install apache2 -y
    a2ensite default-ssl
    a2enmod ssl
    vm_hostname="$(curl -H "Metadata-Flavor:Google" \
    http://169.254.169.254/computeMetadata/v1/instance/name)"
    echo "Page served from: $vm_hostname" | \
    tee /var/www/html/index.html
    systemctl restart apache2'
    ```
2. Create a managed instance group based on the template using the command 
    ```
    gcloud compute instance-groups managed create lb-backend-group \
    --template=lb-backend-template --size=2 --zone=us-central1-a
    ```

3. Create the ```fw-allow-health-check``` firewall rule. This is an ingress rule that allows traffic from the Google Cloud health checking systems ```(130.211.0.0/22 and 35.191.0.0/16)```. This lab uses the target tag allow-health-check to identify the VMs using the command
    ```
    gcloud compute firewall-rules create fw-allow-health-check \
    --network=default \
    --action=allow \
    --direction=ingress \
    --source-ranges=130.211.0.0/22,35.191.0.0/16 \
    --target-tags=allow-health-check \
    --rules=tcp:80
    ```

4. Now that the instances are up and running, set up a global static external IP address that your customers use to reach your load balancer using the command 
    ```gcloud compute addresses create lb-ipv4-1 \
    --ip-version=IPV4 \
    --global
    ```

    Note the IPv4 address that was reserved using the command 
    ```
    gcloud compute addresses describe lb-ipv4-1 \
    --format="get(address)" \
    --global
    ``` 

5. Create a healthcheck for the load balancer using the command
    ```
    gcloud compute health-checks create http http-basic-check \
    --port 80
    ```

6. Create a backend service using the command
    ```
    gcloud compute backend-services create web-backend-service \
    --protocol=HTTP \
    --port-name=http \
    --health-checks=http-basic-check \
    --global
    ```
7. Add your instance group as the backend to the backend service using the command 
    ```
    gcloud compute backend-services add-backend web-backend-service \
    --instance-group=lb-backend-group \
    --instance-group-zone=us-central1-a \
    --global
    ```

8. Create a URL map to route the incoming requests to the default backend service using the command 
    ```
    gcloud compute url-maps create web-map-http \
    --default-service web-backend-service
    ```
9. Create a target HTTP proxy to route requests to your URL map using the command
    ```
    gcloud compute target-http-proxies create http-lb-proxy \
    --url-map web-map-http
    ```

10. Create a global forwarding rule to route incoming requests to the proxy using the command
    ```
    gcloud compute forwarding-rules create http-content-rule \
    --address=lb-ipv4-1\
    --global \
    --target-http-proxy=http-lb-proxy \
    --ports=80
    ```


## Testing traffic sent to your instances
1. Navigation menu --> Network services --> Load balancing
2. Click on the load balancer that you just created (```web-map-http```)
3. In the Backend section, click on the name of the backend and confirm that the VMs are Healthy. If they are not healthy, wait a few moments and try reloading the page
4. When the VMs are healthy, test the load balancer using a web browser, going to ```http://IP_ADDRESS/, replacing IP_ADDRESS``` with the load balancer's IP address

our browser should render a page with content showing the name of the instance that served the page, along with its zone (for example, ```Page served from: lb-backend-group-xxxx```)
