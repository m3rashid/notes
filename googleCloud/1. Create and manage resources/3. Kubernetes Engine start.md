Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) provides a managed environment for deploying, managing, and scaling your containerized applications using Google infrastructure. The Kubernetes Engine environment consists of multiple machines (specifically Compute Engine instances) grouped to form a container cluster. 

Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) clusters are powered by the Kubernetes open source cluster management system. Kubernetes provides the mechanisms through which you interact with your container cluster. You use Kubernetes commands and resources to deploy and manage your applications, perform administrative tasks, set policies, and monitor the health of your deployed workloads.

Kubernetes draws on the same design principles that run popular Google services and provides the same benefits: automatic management, monitoring and liveness probes for application containers, automatic scaling, rolling updates, and more.

When you run a GKE cluster, you also gain the benefit of advanced cluster management features that Google Cloud provides. These include:

1. [Load balancing](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/load-balancing-and-autoscaling) for Compute Engine instances
2. [Node pools](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/node-pools) to designate subsets of nodes within a cluster for additional flexibility
3. [Automatic scaling](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/cluster-autoscaler) of your cluster's node instance count
4. [Automatic upgrades](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/node-auto-upgrade) for your cluster's node software
5. [Node auto-repair](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/node-auto-repair) to maintain node health and availability
6. [Logging and Monitoring](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/logging) with Cloud Monitoring for visibility into your cluster

Activate the cloud shell and do the basic checks ```gcloud auth list``` ```gcloud config list project```
```gcloud config set compute/zone us-central1-a``` to set your default compute zone to us-central1-a

## Create a GKE Cluster
To create a cluster, run the command ```gcloud container clusters create cluster0``` where cluster0 is the name of the cluster

To authenticate the cluster, run the command ```gcloud container clusters get-credentials cluster0```

## Deploy an application to the cluster
You can now deploy a containerized application to the cluster
GKE uses Kubernetes objects to create and manage your cluster's resources. Kubernetes provides the [Deployment](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/) object for deploying stateless applications like web servers. [Service](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/) objects define rules and load balancing for accessing your application from the internet

To create a new Deployment hello-server from the hello-app container image, run the command [```kubectl create```](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubectl/kubectl-commands#create) as ```kubectl create deployment hello-server --image=gcr.io/google-samples/hello-app:1.0```

This Kubernetes command creates a Deployment object that represents hello-server. In this case, --image specifies a container image to deploy. The command pulls the example image from a [Container Registry](https://cloud.google.com/container-registry/docs) bucket. gcr.io/google-samples/hello-app:1.0 indicates the specific image version to pull. If a version is not specified, the latest version is used

To create a Kubernetes Service, which is a Kubernetes resource that lets you expose your application to external traffic, run the command [```kubectl expose```](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubectl/kubectl-commands#expose) as ```kubectl expose deployment hello-server --type=LoadBalancer --port 8080```

In this command:
```--port``` specifies the port that the container exposes.
```type="LoadBalancer"``` creates a Compute Engine load balancer for your container.

To inspect the hello-server Service, run [```kubectl get```](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubectl/kubectl-commands#get) as ```kubectl get service```

Note: It might take a minute for an external IP address to be generated. Run the previous command again if the EXTERNAL-IP column status is pending --> ```http://[EXTERNAL-IP]:8080``` type this url in the new tab to check the working of your web server

## Deleting the cluster
To delete the cluster, run the command ```gcloud container clusters delete [CLUSTER-NAME]``` --> Y to confirm (may take a few minutes to delete the cluster)
