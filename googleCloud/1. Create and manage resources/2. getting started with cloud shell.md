# Getting started with the cloud shell and gcloud

Cloud Shell provides you with command-line access to computing resources hosted on Google Cloud. Cloud Shell is a Debian-based virtual machine with a persistent 5-GB home directory, which makes it easy for you to manage your Google Cloud projects and resources. The gcloud command-line tool and other utilities you need are pre-installed in Cloud Shell, which allows you to get up and running quickly

Activate the cloud shell (from the title bar, top right corner)
Ensure you are with the same account and project using the commands ```gcloud auth list``` and ```gcloud config list project```

## configure your environment
To see the default zone settings, use the commands ```gcloud config get-value compute/zone``` (for zone) and ```gcloud config get-value compute/region```
Note: If the google-compute-default-region or google-compute-default-zone responses are (unset), that means no default zone or region is set

Copy your project id (listed on the dashboard) and run the the command ```gcloud compute project-info describe --project <your_project_ID>``` --> Find the default zone and region metadata values in the output. You'll use the zone (google-compute-default-zone) from the output later in this lab.

Note: If the google-compute-default-region and google-compute-default-zone keys and values are missing from the output, no default zone or region is set

## Set environment variables
Environment variables define your environment and help save time when you write scripts that contain APIs or executables (often thought of as globa variables, or better to say constants)

```export PROJECT_ID=<your_project_ID>``` to assign project id with a variable, for wasy use
Similarly for zone ```export ZONE=<your_zone>```
To verify these constants, use command ```echo $PROJECT_ID``` for project id variable and ```echo $ZONE``` for zone variable

If the variables were set correctly, the echo commands will output your Project ID and Zone

## Create a virtual machine
As done earlier also ```gcloud compute instances create gcelab2 --machine-type n1-standard-2 --zone $ZONE```
If you omit the ```--zone``` flag, the gcloud tool can infer your desired zone based on your default properties. Other required instance settings, such as machine type and image, are set to default values if not specified in the create command

To open help for the create command, run the command ```gcloud compute instances create --help```
Note: in the help output, Press ENTER or the spacebar to scroll through the help content. To exit the content, type Q

The gcloud tool offers simple usage guidelines that are available by adding the -h flag (for help) onto the end of any gcloud command ```gcloud -h```

You can access more verbose help by appending the --help flag onto a command or running the gcloud help command ```gcloud config --help``` or ```gcloud help config```

Other commands
```gcloud config list```        View the list of configurations in your environment
```gcloud config list --all```  To see all properties and their settings
```gcloud components list```    List your components

[gcloud global flags](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/)

## Install new components
```gcloud interactive``` has auto prompting for commands and flags and displays inline help snippets in the lower section of the pane as the command is typed.

You can use dropdown menus to auto-complete static information, such as command and sub-command names, flag names, and enumerated flag values

When using the interactive mode, press TAB to complete file path and resource arguments. If a dropdown menu appears, press TAB to move through the list, and press the spacebar to select your choice.
A list of commands is displayed below the Cloud Shell pane. Pressing F2 toggles the active help section to ON or OFF

```sudo apt-get install google-cloud-sdk``` Install the beta components
```gcloud beta interactive```               Enable the gcloud interactive mode                  
```exit```                                  To exit from the interactive mode, run the following command


## Connect to your VM instance with SSH

To connect to your VM with SSH, run the command ```gcloud compute ssh gcelab2 --zone $ZONE``` --> To continue, type Y --> To leave the passphrase empty, press ENTER twice --> ```exit``` to exit and back to the project's command prompt

## Use the home directory

The contents of your Cloud Shell Home directory persist across projects between all Cloud Shell sessions, even after the virtual machine is terminated and restarted

```cd $HOME```          Change your current working directory
```vi ./.bashrc```      Open your .bashrc configuration file by using the vi text editor, To exit the editor, press ESC, then type :wq, and then press Enter
